// Today you will be building a Node / Express based web applications for handling reservation requests.

// Your application will be made up of two parts:

// 1) A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data and

// 2) A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.









// Bonus:
// If by some miracle you finish early, feel encouraged to work on any one of these additional tasks to take your application to the next level.
// Add code to your server so that it "counts" every time a person visits any of the pages. Display a running count on the website.
// Add buttons for "checking off" individuals from the reservation list. Once this happens, the next person on the waitlist should be addd to the main reservation list.
// Add a button for sending emails to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use node-mailer or a similar npm package to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).
// Add a button for sending text messages to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use the Twilio library to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).
